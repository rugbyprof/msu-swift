Whats the difference between a `tuple` and an `array` or `dictionary` type?

Given:
```swift
var surveyAnswer: String?
```

What would the following output?
```swift
println(surveyAnswer) 
```

##### Assertions

>Optionals enable you to check for values that may or may not exist, and to write code that copes gracefully with the absence of a value. In some cases, however, it is simply not possible for your code to continue execution if a value does not exist, or if a provided value does not satisfy certain conditions. In these situations, you can trigger an assertion in your code to end code execution and to provide an opportunity to debug the cause of the absent or invalid value.
